          <h2>Version 3</h2>
          <h3 id="caveat">Caveat</h3>
          <p>This document attempts to draw the texts of several popular English translations of Lao Tse into a consistent and accessible context. It is based on the translations of Robert G. Henricks, Lin Yutang, D.C. Lau, Ch'u Ta-Kao, Gia-Fu Feng &amp; Jane English, Richard Wilhelm and Aleister Crowley.</p>
          <p>This work is not a translation, but an interpolation.  It does not represent the original text; the original, if there was an original, has been jumbled, mistranscribed and reinterpreted many times over many thousands of years, and is here cast into a language that is incapable of presenting its poetic structure and philological connections.</p>
          <p>Even an original text, translated as faithfully as possible, might remain inaccessible to the modern reader unable to place it within its original context. The intention of this work is to construct a document that closely corresponds with the best modern translations of Lao Tse, but which is blunt, easy and useful to read within a modern context.</p>


          <h3 id="structure">Structural Changes</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>The last three lines of chapter 28 have been moved to the end of Chapter 27.</li>
              <li>The last three lines of chapter 39 have been moved to the end of Chapter 26.</li>
              <li>The last three lines of chapter 47 oppose most translations.</li>
              <li>The first three lines of chapter 54 have been moved to the start of Chapter 38.</li>
              <li>The last two lines of chapter 55, a repetition of the last two lines of chapter 30, have been removed.</li>
              <li>The first line of chapter 60 has been moved to the start of chapter 59.</li>
              <li>Chapter 64 is split into two chapters, 64a and 64b.</li>
              <li>In chapter 64a the order of the second and third paragraphs is reversed.</li>
              <li>The last four lines of Chapter 67 have been moved to the start of Chapter 68.</li>

                <h2>1. The Way</h2>
                <p>The Way that can be experienced is not true;<br>
                The world that can be constructed is not true.<br>
                The Way manifests all that happens and may happen;<br>
                The world represents all that exists and may exist.</p>

                <p>To experience without intention is to sense the world;<br>
                To experience with intention is to anticipate the world.<br>
                These two experiences are indistinguishable;<br>
                Their construction differs but their effect is the same.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond the gate of experience flows the Way,<br>
                Which is ever greater and more subtle than the world.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section id="abstraction">
                <h2>2. Abstraction</h2>
                <p>When beauty is abstracted<br>
                Then ugliness has been implied;<br>
                When good is abstracted<br>
                Then evil has been implied.</p>

                <p>So alive and dead are abstracted from nature,<br>
                Difficult and easy abstracted from progress,<br>
                Long and short abstracted from contrast,<br>
                High and low abstracted from depth,<br>
                Song and speech abstracted from melody,<br>
                After and before abstracted from sequence.</p>

                <p>The sage experiences without abstraction,<br>
                And accomplishes without action;<br>
                He accepts the ebb and flow of things,<br>
                Nurtures them, but does not own them,<br>
                And lives, but does not dwell.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="without-action">
                <h2>3. Without Action</h2>
                <p>Not praising the worthy prevents contention,<br>
                Not esteeming the valuable prevents theft,<br>
                Not displaying the beautiful prevents desire.</p>
            
                <p>In this manner the sage governs people:<br>
                Emptying their minds,<br>
                Filling their bellies,<br>
                Weakening their ambitions,<br>
                And strengthening their bones.</p>

                <p>If people lack knowledge and desire<br>
                Then they can not act;<br>
                If no action is taken<br>
                Harmony remains.</p>

            <section id="limitless">
                <h2>4. Limitless</h2>
                <p>The Way is a limitless vessel;<br>
                Used by the self, it is not filled by the world;<br>
                It cannot be cut, knotted, dimmed or stilled;<br>
                Its depths are hidden, ubiquitous and eternal;<br>
                I don't know where it comes from;<br>
                It comes before nature.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="nature">
                <h2>5. Nature</h2>
                <p>Nature is not kind;<br>
                It treats all things impartially.<br>
                The Sage is not kind,<br>
                And treats all people impartially.</p>

                <p>Nature is like a bellows,<br>
                Empty, yet never ceasing its supply.<br>
                The more it moves, the more it yields;<br>
                So the sage draws upon experience<br>
                And cannot be exhausted.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section id="experience">
                <h2>6. Experience</h2>
                <p>Experience is a riverbed, <br>
                Its source hidden, forever flowing:<br>
                Its entrance, the root of the world,<br>
                The Way moves within it:<br>
                Draw upon it; it will not run dry.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="complete">
                <h2>7. Complete</h2>
                <p>Nature is complete because it does not serve itself.</p>
                
                <p>The sage places himself after and finds himself before,<br>
                Ignores his desire and finds himself content.</p>

                <p>He is complete because he does not serve himself.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="water">
                <h2>8. Water</h2>
                <p>The best of man is like water,<br>
                Which benefits all things, and does not contend with them,<br>
                Which flows in places that others disdain,<br>
                Where it is in harmony with the Way.</p>

                <p>So the sage:<br>
                Lives within nature,<br>
                Thinks within the deep,<br>
                Gives within impartiality,<br>
                Speaks within trust,<br>
                Governs within order,<br>
                Crafts within ability,<br>
                Acts within opportunity.</p>

                <p>He does not contend, and none contend against him.</p>

            <section id="retire">
                <h2>9. Retire</h2>

                <p>Fill a cup to its brim and it is easily spilled;<br>
                Temper a sword to its hardest and it is easily broken;<br>
                Amass the greatest treasure and it is easily stolen;<br>
                Claim credit and honour and you easily fall;<br>
                Retire once your purpose is achieved - this is natural.</p>

                Clearing your mind, you become clear;<br>
                Nurturing your children, you become impartial;<br>

                <h2>31. Armies</h2>
                <p>Armies are tools of violence;<br>
                They cause men to hate and fear.<br>
                The sage will not join them.<br>
                His purpose is creation;<br>
                Their purpose is destruction.</p>

                <p>Weapons are tools of violence, <br>
                Not of the sage;<br>
                He uses them only when there is no choice,<br>
                And then calmly, and with tact,<br>
                For he finds no beauty in them.</p>

                <p>Whoever finds beauty in weapons<br>
                Delights in the slaughter of men;<br>
                And who delights in slaughter <br>
                Cannot content himself with peace.</p>

                <p>So slaughters must be mourned<br>
                And conquest celebrated with a funeral.</p>

                <p>The Way has no true shape,<br>
                And therefore none can control it.<br>
                If a ruler could control the Way<br>
                All things would follow<br>
                In harmony with his desire,<br>
                And sweet rain would fall,<br>

                <p>The Way is shaped by use,<br>
                But then the shape is lost.<br>
                Do not hold fast to shapes<br>
                But let sensation flow into the world<br>
                As a river courses down to the sea.</p>

                <h2>38. Ritual</h2>
                <p>Well established hierarchies are not easily uprooted;<br>
                Closely held beliefs are not easily released;<br>
                So ritual enthralls generation after generation.</p>

                <p>Harmony does not care for harmony, and so is naturally attained;<br>
                But ritual is intent upon harmony, and so can not attain it.</p>

                <p>Harmony neither acts nor reasons;<br>
                Love acts, but without reason;<br>
                Justice acts to serve reason;<br>
                But ritual acts to enforce reason.</p>

                <p>When the Way is lost, there remains harmony;<br>
                When harmony is lost, there remains love;<br>
                When love is lost, there remains justice;<br>
                But when justice is lost, there remains ritual.</p>

                <p>Ritual is the end of compassion and honesty,<br>
                The beginning of confusion;<br>
                Belief is a colourful hope or fear,<br>
                The beginning of folly.</p>

                <p>The sage goes by harmony, not by hope;<br>
                He dwells in the fruit, not the flower;<br>
                He accepts substance, and ignores abstraction.</p>

                <p>In mythical times all things were whole:<br>
                All the sky was clear,<br>
                All the earth was stable,<br>
                All the mountains were firm,<br>
                All the riverbeds were full,<br>
                All of nature was fertile,<br>
                And all the rulers were supported.</p>

                <p>But, losing clarity, the sky tore;<br>
                Losing stability, the earth split;<br>
                Losing strength, the mountains sank;<br>
                Losing water, the riverbeds cracked;<br>
                Losing fertility, nature disappeared;<br>
                And losing support, the rulers fell.</p>

                <p>Rulers depend upon their subjects,<br>
                The noble depend upon the humble;<br>
                So rulers call themselves orphaned, hungry and alone,<br>

                <p>Who recognizes his limitations is healthy;<br>
                Who ignores his limitations is sick.<br>
                The sage recognizes this sickness as a limitation.<br>
                And so becomes immune.</p>

                <h2>72. Revolution</h2>
                <p>When people have nothing more to lose,<br>
                Then revolution will result.</p>
                
                <p>Do not take away their lands,<br>
                And do not destroy their livelihoods;<br>
                If your burden is not heavy then they will not shirk it.</p>
                
                <p>The sage maintains himself but exacts no tribute,<br>
                Values himself but requires no honours;<br>
                He ignores abstraction and accepts substance.</p>

                <h2>73. Fate</h2>
                <p>Who is brave and bold will perish;<br>
                Who is brave and subtle will benefit.<br>
                The subtle profit where the bold perish<br>
                For fate does not honour daring.<br>
                And even the sage dares not tempt fate.</p>
                
                <p>Fate does not attack, yet all things are conquered by it;<br>
                It does not ask, yet all things answer to it;<br>
                It does not call, yet all things meet it;<br>
                It does not plan, yet all things are determined by it.</p>
                
                <p>Fate's net is vast and its mesh is coarse,<br>
                Yet none escape it.</p>

                <p>If people were not afraid of death,<br>
                Then what would be the use of an executioner?</p>
                
                <p>If people were only afraid of death,<br>
                And you executed everyone who did not obey,<br>
                No one would dare to disobey you.<br>
                Then what would be the use of an executioner?</p>
                
                <p>People fear death because death is an instrument of fate.<br>
                When people are killed by execution rather than by fate,<br>
                This is like carving wood in the place of a carpenter.<br>
                Those who carve wood in place of a carpenter<br>
                Often injure their hands.</p>

                <p>When rulers take grain so that they may feast,<br>
                Their people become hungry;<br>
                When rulers take action to serve their own interests,<br>
                Their people become rebellious;<br>
                When rulers take lives so that their own lives are maintained,<br>
                Their people no longer fear death.</p>
                
                <p>When people act without regard for their own lives<br>
                They overcome those who value only their own lives.</p>

                <p>A newborn is soft and tender,<br>
                A crone, hard and stiff.<br>
                Plants and animals, in life, are supple and succulent;<br>
                In death, withered and dry.<br>
                So softness and tenderness are attributes of life,<br>
                And hardness and stiffness, attributes of death.</p>
                
                <p>Just as a sapless tree will split and decay<br>
                So an inflexible force will meet defeat;<br>
                The hard and mighty lie beneath the ground<br>
                While the tender and weak dance on the breeze above.</p>

            <section id="need">
                <h2>77. Need</h2>
                <p>Is the action of nature not unlike drawing a bow?<br>
                What is higher is pulled down, and what is lower is raised up;<br>
                What is taller is shortened, and what is thinner is broadened;<br>
                Nature's motion decreases those who have more than they need<br>
                And increases those who need more than they have.</p>
                
                <p>It is not so with Man.<br>
                Man decreases those who need more than they have<br>
                And increases those who have more than they need.</p>
                
                <p>To give away what you do not need is to follow the Way.<br>
                So the sage gives without expectation,<br>
                Accomplishes without claiming credit,<br>
                And has no desire for ostentation.</p>

            <section id="yielding">
                <h2>78. Yielding</h2>
                <p>Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water,<br>
                Yet nothing can better overcome the hard and strong,<br>
                For they can neither control nor do away with it.</p>
                
                <p>The soft overcomes the hard,<br>
                The yielding overcomes the strong;<br>
                Every person knows this,<br>
                But no one can practice it.</p>
                
                <p>Who attends to the people would control the land and grain;<br>
                Who attends to the state would control the whole world;<br>
                Truth is easily hidden by rhetoric.</p>

                <h2>79. Reconciliation</h2>
                <p>When conflict is reconciled, some hard feelings remain;<br>
                This is dangerous.</p>
                
                <p>The sage accepts less than is due<br>
                And does not blame or punish;<br>
                For harmony seeks agreement<br>
                Where justice seeks payment.</p>
                
                <p>The ancients said: "nature is impartial;<br>
                Therefore it serves those who serve all."</p>

                <p>Let your community be small, with only a few people;<br>
                Keep tools in abundance, but do not depend upon them;<br>
                Appreciate your life and be content with your home;<br>
                Sail boats and ride horses, but don't go too far;<br>
                Keep weapons and armour, but do not employ them;<br>
                Let everyone read and write,<br>
                Eat well and make beautiful things.</p>
                
                <p>Live peacefully and delight in your own society;<br>
                Dwell within cock-crow of your neighbours,<br>
                But maintain your independence from them.</p>

                <h2>81. The Sage</h2>
                <p>Honest people use no rhetoric;<br>
                Rhetoric is not honesty.<br>
                Enlightened people are not cultured;<br>
                Culture is not enlightenment.<br>
                Content people are not rich;<br>
                Riches are not contentment.</p>
                
                <p>So the sage does not serve himself;<br>
                The more he does for others, the more he is satisfied;<br>
                The more he gives, the more he receives.<br>
                Nature flourishes at the expense of no one;<br>
                So the sage benefits all men and contends with none.</p>
